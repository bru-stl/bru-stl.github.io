## We're Bus Riders United 
### Tired of waiting? So are we
Bi-State Development, Metro, and St Louis government continue to ignore struggling bus riders during this pandemic. But together, we can demand they listen to us. By building a bus riders union we can build power to ensure real issues are solved:

- Further 10% service cut coming November 2021
- Not enough good bus stops
- Not enough bus drivers
- Buses not showing up
- Indoor waiting and warming areas closed
- Bus stops removed without notice
- Metrolink being prioritized over buses
- Transit info only available 7am-6pm M-F

## Helpful info for riders
### Upcoming Service changes
Due to an ongoing labor shortage, Bi-State is implementing a [number of service cuts in November](https://cmt-stl.org/metro-transit-to-reduce-service-hours-due-to-workforce-shortage-expanding-via-pilot-to-fill-in-gaps/) on 27 routes. These include
> - 14 Local routes will adjust weekday daytime service from 30-minute to either 40- or 60-minute frequency
> - 4 Frequent routes will adjust weekday daytime service (3 routes moving from 15-minute to 20- minute frequency, and one route moving from 20- to 30-minute frequency)
> - 2 routes will have evening service reduced from 30- to 60-minutes
> - 4 routes will shorten the evening span of service due to low nighttime demand; 3 of those routes, located in North County, have a replacement microtransit service after 8PM
> - 6 routes temporarily suspended
>   - Includes all 4 Express routes
>   - Includes 2 local routes in South and West County — #46-Tesson Ferry and #65-Outer Forties – which will be fully covered by microtransit service


### Get a free Lyft if you miss your bus
If you have a wait of 30 minutes or more due to your bus not showing up for its scheduled trip, [Metro will set up a ride on Lyft for you to get you to your destination](https://www.metrostlouis.org/nextstop/checking-the-status-of-your-metrobus-in-transit/).

Give Transit Information team a call if your bus does not arrive at [314.231.2345](tel:3142312345), although their hours are only 7am - 6pm Monday thru Friday.

Outside of those hours, Transit Service Managers and Public Safety team are able to assist: contact Public Safety 24/7 by calling [314.289.6873](tel:3142896873).
