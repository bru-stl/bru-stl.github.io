## It's time we had the bus system we deserve
We depend every day on our bus system, and yet it *constantly* leaves us waiting. 

People running local governments and transit agencies rarely use transit themselves, meaning our real problems are misunderstood and ignored, for example:

> * A further 10% service cut coming [later this month](posts/november-2021-service-cuts)
> * Not enough good bus stops with shelters
> * Not enough bus drivers, meaning buses often don't show up
> * Back-door boarding ended pre-emptively
> * Indoor waiting and warming areas closed for well over a year
> * Bus stops regularly being removed without notice
> * Metrolink prioritized over buses
> * Transit information only available 7am-6pm Mon-Fri

But working together, we can make ourselves impossible to ignore. [Join us today](join), and be a part of our fight for a better bus system!
