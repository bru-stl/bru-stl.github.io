# Our first meeting is Nov 29: [details here](/riders-meetings/2021-11-29)

## It's time St Louis had the bus system we deserve
We depend every day on it, and yet we are still *constantly* left waiting. 

The solutions are straightforward to us: more buses, more bus drivers, more bus shelters. Unfortunately, people running local governments and transit agencies rarely use transit themselves, meaning our real problems are misunderstood and ignored. For instance:

> * A further 10% service cut coming [later this month](rider-info/november-2021-service-cuts)
> * Not enough good bus stops with shelters
> * Sidewalks to/from bus stops in terrible condition
> * Not enough bus drivers, meaning buses often don't show up
> * Back-door boarding ended before it was safe to do so
> * Indoor waiting and warming areas closed for well over a year
> * Bus stops regularly being removed without notice
> * Metrolink turnstiles prioritized over bus service
> * Transit information only available 7am-6pm Mon-Fri

But working together, we can make ourselves impossible to ignore. [Join us today](join), and be a part of our fight for a better bus system!
