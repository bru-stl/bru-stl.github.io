# Take our [3-question Rider Survey](/rider-survey)!

## It's time St Louis had the bus system we deserved.
We depend on it every day, and yet we are *constantly* left waiting. The solutions are straightforward to bus riders: we see the issues firsthand.

### We call on Bi-State to:
* **Invest in our operators**
    * A long-standing pay-and-benefits shortage has left us with a serious lack of operators and an extremely strained bus system. Words only go so far: it's time that operators get the raise they deserve for their vital frontline work during this pandemic.
* **Reverse COVID service cuts**
    * Massive [service cuts in November](/rider-info/service-changes/november-2021-service-cuts/) and [March](/rider-info/service-changes/march-2022-service-cuts) were supposed to be temporary and reduce undependable buses, but riders are still being left in the cold far too often. A raise in starting pay and improving working conditions will also help to attract the necessary staff to provide reliable transit service.
* **Take safety seriously**
    * Metro's approach to bus riders' safety leaves much to be desired: bus riders are left without transit centers for warmth during the coldest parts of the day, often with even longer waits due to service cuts. Also, rear-door boarding, a powerful tool to protect bus riders and operators during an airborne pandemic, was ended after only three months.
