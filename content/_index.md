# Take our [3-question Rider Survey](/rider-survey)!

## It's time St Louis had the bus system we deserved.
We depend on it every day, and yet we are *constantly* left waiting. The solutions are straightforward to bus riders: we see the issues firsthand.

### We call on Bi-State to:
* **Invest in our operators**
    * A long-standing pay-and-benefits shortage has left us with a serious lack of operators and an extremely strained bus system. Words only go so far: it's time that operators get the raise they deserve for their vital frontline work during this pandemic.
* **Reverse COVID service cuts**
    * Massive [service cuts in November](http://www.brustl.org/rider-info/november-2021-service-cuts/) were supposed to be temporary and reduce undependable buses, but riders are still being left in the cold far too often. A raise in starting pay and improving working conditions will also help to attract the necessary staff to provide reliable transit service.
* **Take COVID safety seriously**
    * Rear-door boarding was a powerful tool to protect bus riders and operators during an airborne pandemic. But it was ended only three months into the pandemic, and despite surges since, the agency has failed to re-implement.
