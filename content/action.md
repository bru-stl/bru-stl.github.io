draft: true

## We need your help 
Bi-State and Metro's leadership never use the bus, and so they don't prioritize the bus. This means we have to take action into our own hands and lobby for ourselves. 

## Current action items:
These are currently our goals:

> 1. Reverse all bus service cuts
> 2. Institute a low-income fare option & monthly/weekly fare-capping
> 3. Improve bus frequencies and bus stop amenities
