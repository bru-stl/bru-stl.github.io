Bi-State Development, Metro, and St Louis government continue to ignore struggling bus riders during this pandemic. But together, we can demand they listen to us. By building a bus riders union we can build power to ensure real issues are solved:

- Further 10% service cut coming November 2021
- Not enough good bus stops
- Not enough bus drivers
- Buses not showing up
- Indoor waiting and warming areas closed
- Bus stops removed without nobtice
- Metrolink being prioritized over buses
- Transit info only available 7am-6pm M-F
