## Frequency is freedom.

Having a frequent bus network is one of the best ways we can build and sustain transit usership. When a bus is frequent, missing a bus doesn't mean a half-hour wait (or more) as punishment - it means knowing another bus is only a few minutes away. 

Before 2018, only one bus line, the #70 Grand, ran every 15 minutes or better. As a part of a network redesign entitled Metro Reimagined, the #70 moved up to every 10 minutes, and 9 other bus lines were moved up to a 15 minute weekday frequency. *(The initial plan promised 11 newly high frequency lines; the final draft only had 9, with the #4 and #10 being cut to 30 minute lines instead.)*

Unfortunately, COVID's impact on transit has meant that most of these improvements were short-lived, and with [November's cuts](/rider-info/november-2021-service-cuts), **we're back to only one line with a 15 minute frequency again**. A few remain with 20 minute frequencies, but the scattered mess of a schedule below is a far cry from the predictable and easy bus schedules we were promised in Metro Reimagined. Bi-State claims these cuts are only temporary.
