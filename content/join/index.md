## Join Bus Riders United

Transit rider unions are growing across the United States, as people who rely on transit every day get tired of watching their transportation get worse. Meanwhile, billions are poured into highways and cars.

People running local government and transit agencies rarely use transit themselves, meaning our problems are misunderstood and ignored. For example, why is so much time and money put into  policing when we have a severe shortage of bus drivers?  Why is so much energy spent on the Metrolink compared to the buses, when most riders take the bus? 

By working together as bus riders, we can demand that our bus system is the one that we deserve. But we can only do it together- which means we need you! If you are interested in helping us to build Bus Riders United.
