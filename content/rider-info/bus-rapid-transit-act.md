Today, St Louis's representative Cori Bush introduced the [Bus Rapid Transit Act](/link-to-come) in the halls of congress. If passed, the act would authorize $12 billion in new funding annually for improved bus rapid transit (or BRT) across the United States. 

We know that [the best bus line is a frequent bus line](/rider-info/frequencies), but one challenge that transit agencies currently face is that a high frequency means needing to hire more drivers. Labor is generally the most expensive part of transit, and current federal regulations require that local and state funding cover labor and most other operating costs. The Bus Rapid Transit Act would fundamentally change this equation for the better, allowing funds to be used for **both construction and operation of covered BRT systems**, with the federal government covering up to **85%** of these costs. 

The act also specifies a number of requirements for covered BRT systems to ensure that they are effective, including:
> - Center-running, dedicated right-of-ways for buses
> - High quality, safe, and accessible stops and stations
> - All buses must be electric and powered by renewable energy
> - A prohibition on an increase in fares due to BRT improvements
> - Numerous other best-practice design specifications

For an example of a center-running BRT, see the [Red Line in Indianapolis](https://thefoxandthecity.com/articles/riding-the-red-line-indianapolis-americas-new-brt-gold-standard):

St Louis (located in a [state which notoriously refuses to fund transit](https://ridesmts.org/transit-funding/)) would benefit massively from the Bus Rapid Transit Act, allowing us the opportunity to build out multiple world-class BRT lines, bridging divides in our region and immensely improving quality of life for those who do not or cannot drive. And since BRT can be built much faster and more cost-effectively than other options like light-rail, we could have a whole network of BRT lines for the price of only a single new Metrolink line. **To wit: the Indianapolis Red Line mentioned above cost $96 million to build out a 13 mile segment, while the current estimate for a 7 mile segment of the North-South Metrolink was priced out around $600 million.**

On top of that, since federal funding would replace some portion of local funding currently used for operations, Metro would be able to shift those funds to other lines, allowing for better frequencies and more reliable service even on non-BRT lines.

The act is still in early stages, but we are excited about the opportunities that it holds. We consider ourselves lucky to have this bill's sponsor as our representative, and we ask you to urge your congressperson to support the Bus Rapid Transit Act.
