If you have a wait of 30 minutes or more due to your bus not showing up for its scheduled trip, [Metro will set up a ride on Lyft for you to get you to your destination](https://www.metrostlouis.org/nextstop/checking-the-status-of-your-metrobus-in-transit/).

Give Transit Information team a call if your bus does not arrive at [314.231.2345](tel:3142312345), although their hours are only 7am - 6pm Monday thru Friday.

Outside of those hours, Transit Service Managers and Public Safety team are able to assist: contact Public Safety 24/7 by calling [314.289.6873](tel:3142896873).
