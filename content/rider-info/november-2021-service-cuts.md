Starting this month Bi-State will be implementing a [number of service cuts](https://cmt-stl.org/metro-transit-to-reduce-service-hours-due-to-workforce-shortage-expanding-via-pilot-to-fill-in-gaps/) on 27 routes. These changes include:
<!--more-->
> - 14 Local routes will adjust weekday daytime service from 30-minute to either 40- or 60-minute frequency 
> - 4 Frequent routes will adjust weekday daytime service (3 routes moving from 15-minute to 20- minute frequency, and one route moving from 20- to 30-minute frequency)
> - 2 routes will have evening service reduced from 30- to 60-minutes
> - 4 routes will shorten the evening span of service due to low nighttime demand; 3 of those routes, located in North County, have a replacement microtransit service after 8PM
> - 6 routes temporarily suspended
>   - Includes all 4 Express routes
>   - Includes 2 local routes in South and West County — #46-Tesson Ferry and #65-Outer Forties – which will be fully covered by microtransit service
