As a result of Bi-State's neglect for our bus system, riders are often left puzzled with policies. We compile here answered and unanswered transit policy questions that riders have.

If you have a question you think should be up here, please reach out to us.

## *Answered*

### Fares and passes
> **What can I do with expired two-hour passes?** \
> Many fare media purchased at fare machines have an expiration date. If you purchase these fares but have not had a chance to use them before expiration, they can be exchanged at the MetroStore (at 8th & Pine station) for new fares.

### Bus arrivals
> **What can I do if my bus doesn't show?** \
> Metro will order you a Lyft if your bus doesn't show for over 30 minutes. [More details on that program here.](rider-info/metro-free-lyft-ride)

> **How can I tell if my trip has been canceled in the trasit app?** \
> Metro has compiled a useful guide on this and [listed it on their blog](https://www.metrostlouis.org/nextstop/checking-the-status-of-your-metrobus-in-transit/).

## *Unanswered*

### Fares and passes

> **Why is using the bus more expensive than before the pandemic?** \
> Due to the elimination of two-hour transfers ($3) on the bus, catching a bus and then getting on the train means buying a $1 bus fare and a $2.50 train fare. *(assuming you don't have still another bus to catch!)*

> **When will weekly and monthly fare-capping be implemented?** \
> Fare cards and mobile ticketing are exciting because they allow us to implement [fare-capping](https://transitcenter.org/fare-capping-formula-fairer-fares/). This would mean that buying single rides on the bus throughout the month would never cost more than the price of a monthly pass. Why should riders who can't afford to buy a pass all at once end up paying more over the course of a month.
>
> *Since Metro already has a [daily cap](https://www.metrostlouis.org/gatewaycard/) on their card, weekly and daily should be straightforward to add, and would have a huge effect on improving fare equity.*

### Bus arrivals

> **What are Metro & Bi-State doing to resolve the driver shortage?** \
> Outside of a starting bonus incentive (which has been in effect for some time now, and seems not to be filling our coverage gap), we haven't heard any other strategies to increase the number of applicants.

### Safety

> **When will transit waiting centers reopen?** \
> Indoor waiting areas at transit centers were closed at the start of the pandemic. In December they were reopened, but are only in operation 6am-6pm.

> **Why were public safety logs made inaccessible to the public?** \
> Metro's website previously shared a public log of Public Safety's calls, [as found on their site in April 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190408195219/https://www.metrostlouis.org/safety-and-security/). Removing public access to this data obscures any oversight from the public, especially when the data before removal showed a stark uptick in fare violation calls.
