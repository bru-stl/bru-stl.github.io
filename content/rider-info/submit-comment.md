The next Bi-State Board of Commissioners meeting is **Friday, November 19 @ 8:30am**. We strongly encourage you to ask Bi-State to improve starting pay and benefits for bus drivers, so that we can fill our steep operator shortage and reduce the amount of time riders will spend freezing, waiting at bus stops this winter. Your comments will be read to the board during their meeting. <!--more--> 

You can fill out [this form](https://www.bistatedev.org/public-meetings/public-comment-form/) to send Bi-State your comments.

### What is Bi-State Development?
Bi-State Development (BSD) is the organization that runs Metro. They are overseen by an appointed Board of Commissioners, who meet regularly to oversee the organization. Due to the pandemic, their meetings have been moved to being run virtually. You can find videos of [recent meetings here](https://www.youtube.com/user/MetroStLouisTransit).
