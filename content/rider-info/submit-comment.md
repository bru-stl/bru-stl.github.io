The next Bi-State Board of Commissioners meeting is **Friday, December 10th @ 10am**. This is a special session, likely in order to rubber-stamp a $52 million turnstile plan, while our bus system sees a substantial service cut. <!--more--> 

At their [previous meeting](/rider-info/bi-state/2021-11-19-meeting), Bi-State refused to read *any* of our 36 submitted comments, likely violating their own policies. Our comments were nearly uniform in calling for better bus driver wages and a better bus system, while the commissioners' business was focused almost entirely on turnstiles for the Metrolink.

**We ask you to again call on the Bi-State board to improve bus driver pay and conditions so that we can fill our labor shortage.** A few points that may help inform your comments:

* Starting pay at Metro is **$15.88/hr**, across the state in Kansas City it is **$17.48/hr**. 
* Bus drivers deserve hazard pay for keeping us running during a pandemic
* We are still trying to fill over 100 bus driver roles, and are having trouble retaining drivers.
* Rear-door boarding was only used until June 1, 2020, despite safety risks from COVID
* Indoor waiting areas remain closed despite extreme low temperatures approaching
* Bi-State's only attempt to fill the role so far is a one-time $2,000 bonus 
    * Drivers receive the one-time bonus 2 years after starting 

[Please fill out this form](https://www.bistatedev.org/public-meetings/public-comment-form/) to send Bi-State your comments. They will read your comments at the start of their meeting on Friday, December 10.
