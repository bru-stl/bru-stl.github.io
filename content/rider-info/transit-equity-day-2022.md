#### What is Transit Equity Day?
Transit equity day is [a national day of action to commemorate the birthday of Rosa Parks by declaring that public transit is a civil right](https://sites.google.com/labor4sustainability.org/organizingtoolkit2022/TED2022OrgToolkit). Bus Riders United is excited to thank transit operators for their service, and help educate and organize riders on how we can push for more and better buses in St Louis. 

We will be handing out hand warmers, paired with surveys about your bus ride. We hope to use these to inform our future action as a bus riders union. We hope that you will stop by, say hello, and learn more about how we can help in the fight for better buses in St Louis!

### Why hand warmers?
Great question! In March 2020, due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Metro's interior waiting areas were closed, and with good reason, given the nature of an unknown and new respiratory pandemic. 

But even as other safety measures have been reversed (for example, boarding at the rear door to prevent COVID transmission is no longer used), indoor waiting areas remain closed, even as we are in the midst of our second wickedly cold midwestern winter without them. 

There is no clear criteria for their reopening or use - even to masked and/or vaccinated riders. And with wait times compounded by the massive operator shortage (itself compounded by Bi-State's failure to provide better wages and hazard pay to drivers), the issue approaches a public health crisis.

We're just a bus riders union, and have no say over when Metro will reopen its waiting centers. But we *do* know that it is *really cold!* And hope some hand warmers will help at least a little bit while you're waiting on your bus. If you [join our effort](/join) you can help us push Metro to build a bus system we can actually depend on.
