**When:** November 29, 7PM \
**Where:** 2912 Chippewa (right by a #11 Chippewa bus stop) \
**Who:** Bus riders ready for better buses 

**We got over 30 people to submit comment to Bi-State's [meeting on the 19th](/rider-info/bi-state/2021-11-19-meeting/) calling for them to improve bus driver pay and conditions.** Other bus improvements were also mentioned often in the comments, including improved frequencies, bus lanes, free fares, and better bus stops. **The Board of Commissioners, however, decided not to read any of the comments, due to "time constraints."** Instead, they discussed and approved a plan to use $52 million on turnstiles, something that none of the comments had asked for. 

**On the same day as our meeting, 27 bus lines will be getting cut or cut back, and Bi-State is still not doing little fill the driver shortage. It's clear we have a lot of work to do.** Join us for a meeting at the Melvin Theatre on Chippewa to explore our next steps, and how we can build a bus riders union to fight for (and win!) the better buses we deserve.

**This event will be indoors, masks will be required.**
