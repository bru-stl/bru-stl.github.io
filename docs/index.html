<h3 id="we-call-on-bi-state-to">We call on Bi-State to:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest in our operators</strong>
<ul>
<li>A long-standing pay-and-benefits shortage has left us with a serious lack of operators and an extremely strained bus system. Words only go so far: it&rsquo;s time that operators get the raise they deserve for their vital frontline work during this pandemic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reverse COVID service cuts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Massive <a href="/rider-info/service-changes/november-2021-service-cuts/">service cuts in November</a> and <a href="/rider-info/service-changes/march-2022-service-cuts">March</a> were supposed to be temporary and reduce undependable buses, but riders are still being left in the cold far too often. A raise in starting pay and improving working conditions will also help to attract the necessary staff to provide reliable transit service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Take safety seriously</strong>
<ul>
<li>Metro&rsquo;s approach to bus riders' safety leaves much to be desired: bus riders are left without transit centers for warmth during the coldest parts of the day, often with even longer waits due to service cuts. Also, rear-door boarding, a powerful tool to protect bus riders and operators during an airborne pandemic, was ended after only three months.</li>

        <p>Having a frequent bus network is one of the best ways we can build and sustain transit usership. When a bus is frequent, missing a bus doesn&rsquo;t mean a half-hour wait (or more) as punishment - it means knowing another bus is only a few minutes away. When transit is reliable, people are willing to use it more, and shift away from using a car.</p>
