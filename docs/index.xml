      <description>Bi-State Development, Metro, and St Louis government continue to ignore struggling bus riders during this pandemic. But together, we can demand they listen to us. By building a bus riders union we can build power to ensure real issues are solved:
 Further 10% service cut coming November 2021 Not enough good bus stops Not enough bus drivers Buses not showing up Indoor waiting and warming areas closed Bus stops removed without nobtice Metrolink being prioritized over buses Transit info only available 7am-6pm M-F  </description>

      <description>Helpful info for bus riders Get a free Lyft if you miss your bus If you have a wait of 30 minutes or more due to your bus not showing up for its scheduled trip, Metro will set up a ride on Lyft for you to get you to your destination.
Give Transit Information team a call if your bus does not arrive at 314.231.2345, although their hours are only 7am - 6pm Monday thru Friday.</description>
