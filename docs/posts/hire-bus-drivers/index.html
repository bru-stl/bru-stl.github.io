    <p>We&rsquo;re well over a year and a half into the COVID pandemic, and our the state of our bus system is dimmer than ever. With days getting shorter and temperatures dropping, it&rsquo;s one of the hardest times of the year to rely on the bus in the first place, and <a href="/rider-info/november-2021-service-cuts.md">recently announced cutbacks on 27 bus lines</a> paint a bleak picture.</p>
