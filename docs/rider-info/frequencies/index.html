    <p>Having a frequent bus network is one of the best ways we can build and sustain transit usership. When a bus is frequent, missing a bus doesn&rsquo;t mean a half-hour wait (or more) as punishment - it means knowing another bus is only a few minutes away. When transit is reliable, people are willing to use it more, and shift away from using a car.</p>
<p>Transit consultant Jarrett Walker&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://humantransit.org/2011/12/how-frequent-is-freedom.html">Human Transit</a></em> mentions that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in most cases, the threshold of ‚Äúhigh frequency‚Äù is around every 15 minutes all day. Lower frequencies are usually associated with much lower performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before 2018, only one bus line in St Louis, the #70 Grand, ran every 15 minutes or better. As a part of a network redesign entitled <strong>&ldquo;Metro Reimagined&rdquo;</strong>, the #70 moved up to running every 10 minutes most of the day, and 10 other bus lines were moved up to a 15 minute weekday frequency. The tagline for this promising system change on Metro&rsquo;s site was:</p>
<p><img src="/images/metro-reimagined-tagline.jpg" alt="Metro Reimagined tagline: &ldquo;Shorter waits. Faster trips. Better connections.""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, COVID&rsquo;s impact on transit has meant that most of these improvements were short-lived, and with <a href="/rider-info/november-2021-service-cuts">the service cuts beginning today</a>, <strong>we&rsquo;re back to only one line with a 15 minute frequency</strong>. A few lines still have 20 minute frequencies for a portion of weekday service, but the scattered mess of a schedule below is a far cry from the predictable and easy bus schedules we were promised in Metro Reimagined. <em>People need reliable and frequent service not only during commute hours, but also on weekends and evenings.</em> Building transit ridership requires making the bus easy to use <em>all of the time.</em></p>
<p>Bi-State claims these cuts are only temporary. <a href="/public-comment">Please send public comment before their December 10 meeting</a>, urging them to hire more drivers and reverse the service cuts.</p>
<p><em>And join <a href="/join">Bus Riders United STL</a> so we can push for better, faster, and more frequent buses!</em></p>
