    <p>The next Bi-State Board of Commissioners meeting is <strong>Friday, December 10 @ 8:30am</strong>. This is a special session, likely in order to rubber-stamp a $52 million turnstile plan, while our bus system gets a 15% service cut.</p>
<p>At their <a href="/rider-info/bi-state/2021-11-19-meeting">previous meeting</a>, Bi-State refused to read <em>any</em> of our 36 submitted comments, likely violating their own policies. Our comments were nearly uniform in calling for better bus driver wages and a better bus system, while the commissioners' business was focused almost entirely on turnstiles for the Metrolink.</p>
<p><strong>We ask you to again call on the Bi-State board to improve bus driver pay and conditions so that we can fill our labor shortage.</strong> A few points that may help inform your comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting pay at Metro is <strong>$15.88/hr</strong>, across the state in Kansas City it is <strong>$17.48/hr</strong>.</li>
<li>Bus drivers deserve hazard pay for keeping us running during a pandemic</li>
<li>We are still trying to fill over 100 bus driver roles, and are having trouble retaining drivers.</li>
<li>Rear-door boarding was only used until June 1, 2020, despite safety risks from COVID</li>
<li>Indoor waiting areas remain closed despite extreme low temperatures approaching</li>
<li>Bi-State&rsquo;s only attempt to fill the role so far is a one-time $2,000 bonus
<ul>
<li>Drivers receive the one-time bonus 2 years after starting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
