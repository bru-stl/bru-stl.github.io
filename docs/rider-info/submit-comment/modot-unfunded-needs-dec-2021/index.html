<p>The Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) are currently accepting public comments on how to prioritize funding of transportation projects across the state which are currently unfunded.</p>
<p>As noted in the draft plan on <a href="https://www.modot.org/unfundedneeds">their website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since transportation needs greatly outweigh funding available, the challenge is determining the optimal projects to fund that provide the greatest return on investment to taxpayers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they are accepting comments, we as bus riders can have a sway in the decision about which projects to fund. Of note, there are two projects on the St Louis list which would help to improve our buses:</p>


<div class="CenteredTable">

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Project</th>
<th>Cost</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Update all Metro bus stops to ADA Standard</em></td>
<td>$7,700,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Electric bus aqcuisition at Metro</em></td>
<td>$12,000,000</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


</div>

<p>Updating all bus stops to the ADA standard will ensure that your bus stop is accessible. And adding more electric buses to our fleet will help to swap out diesel buses with cleaner and quieter ones.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.modot.org/high-priority-unfunded-needs-public-meetings">public meeting</a> on <strong>December 8, 4-6pm</strong> at the Forest Park Visitor Center (5595 Grand Dr, St. Louis, MO 63112), where you can learn more about  the list of needs, ask any questions, and provide your feedback.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend, <strong>please submit your comments or questions to MoDOT on the draft by Wednesday, Dec. 22</strong> using <a href="https://www.modot.org/submit-comments">this form</a>, and please share this information with anyone who wants to see better buses in St Louis.</p>
