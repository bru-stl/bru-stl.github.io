<p>Over 30 people sent in comment to Bi-State&rsquo;s <a href="/rider-info/bi-state/2021-11-19-meeting/">meeting on the 19th</a> calling for them to improve bus driver pay and conditions. Other bus improvements were also mentioned often in the comments, including improved frequencies, bus lanes, free fares, and better bus stops. <strong>The Board of Commissioners, however, decided not to read any of the comments, due to &ldquo;time constraints.&quot;</strong> Instead, they discussed and approved a plan to use $52 million on turnstiles, something that none of the comments had asked for.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s clear we have a lot of work to do.</strong> Join us for a meeting at the Melvin Theatre on Chippewa to explore our next steps, and how we can build a bus riders union to fight for (and win!) the better buses we deserve.</p>
<p><em>This event will be indoors, masks will be required.</em></p>
